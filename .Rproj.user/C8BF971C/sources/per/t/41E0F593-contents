### Standard Metabolic Rate Graph
```{r SMR graph}
ggplot(SMR, aes(x= Mass , y= Average_MR , shape=Sex, lty = Sex))+
  geom_point(aes(size = 2))+
  geom_smooth(method=(lm), se= FALSE)+
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Oxygen Consumption (mL O2 hour-1)")+
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

```
<span> **Graph 1.** Shows the relationship between mass and standard metabolic rate in male and female cottonmouths, <em>Agkistrodon piscivorus</em>.</span>


### Energic Costs of Shedding
```{r Energic costs of shedding}
 
ggplot(SMR, aes(x= Mass , y= Average_MR, shape=Shedding, lty = Shedding))+
  geom_point(aes(size = 2))+
  geom_smooth(method=(lm), se = FALSE)+
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Oxygen Consumption (mL O2 hour-1)")+
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)
```
<span> **Graph 2.** Depicts that energetic costs of shedding in individual cottonmouths. </span>

### Statistical Analysis for Shedding
<span> An ancova was used to determine there is no significant difference between shedding and non-shedding individual's metabolic rate when accounting for mass. (p=0.142, r<sup>2</sup>=0.6757, F-stat = 27.04, df=2,23) </span>
```{r Analysis}
Shed_SMR <- lm(Average_MR ~ Mass + Shedding, data = SMR)
Shed_anova <- anova(Shed_SMR)
summary(Shed_SMR)
```
 
### Relationship between Blood Draw Speed and Temperature
```{r Base time and temp relationship}
ggplot(SMR, aes(x= Basetime , y= BaseTemp))+
  geom_point(aes(size = 2))+
  geom_smooth(method=(lm), se= FALSE)+
  xlab("Base Time (minutes)") + ylab("Base Temperature (C)")+
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
<span> **Graph 3** shows the Base Time which is the time to draw a blood sample after capture, and the associated temperature at the time collection. </span>  

### Statistical Summary for Blood Draw Speed and Temperature
The statistical summary below shows that there is no significant relationship between the time to blood after capture and the cloacal temperature at the time of blood aquisition. 
```{r Statistical analysis for Blood time and temp}
blood <- lm(BaseTemp ~ Basetime, data = SMR)
blood_anova <- anova(blood)
summary(blood)
```

### Summary of All Data Collected 
<span> The summary below gives a snap shot of the first 15 rows of data used in the graphs depicted. </span>

```{r Table 1}

kable(SMR[1:15, ], format = "pandoc", caption = '<strong>Table 1.</strong>  A knitr table depicting the first 15 rows of data found in the SMR dataset.')
```      

### Summary Tables for Data
<span> Table 2 and 3 depicts summary data of the average metabolic rates and average blood draw time of all cottonmouths, and the standard deviations between individuals and between times </span>
```{r Table 2}
SMRsummary <- summarise(group_by(SMR),
                      n=n(), 
                      mean=mean(Average_MR), 
                      sd=sd(Mass))
kable(SMRsummary, format = "pandoc", caption = '<strong>Table 2.</strong>  A summary table displaying the number of snakes captured, the average metabolic rate, and standard deviation of mass.') 
```

```{r Table 3}
SMRsummary <- summarise(group_by(SMR),
                      n=n(), 
                      mean=mean(Basetime), 
                      sd=sd(Basetime))
kable(SMRsummary, format = "pandoc", caption = '<strong>Table 3.</strong>  Depicts the average time to draw blood and the standard deviation between draw times.') 
```
 
### Map of Capture Locations
<span> This interactive map shows the capture location of the `r nrow(SMR)` snakes captured in 2019. </span>

```{r Map of study area}
leaflet(data=SMR) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
      addMarkers(data = SMR, lat = ~Latitude, lng = ~Longitude)
```
